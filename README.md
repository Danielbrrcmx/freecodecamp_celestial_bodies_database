#"Celestial Bodies Relational Database Project

Welcome to the Celestial Bodies Relational Database project! This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum and focuses on creating a comprehensive database for various celestial bodies such as planets, stars, moons, and galaxies. Our goal is to design a well-structured and normalized database that captures essential characteristics of these celestial entities.

Key Features:

Structured database schema for planets, stars, moons, and galaxies.
Utilizes PostgreSQL for relational database management.
Includes foreign keys for establishing relationships between tables.
Represents various attributes of celestial bodies, such as size, temperature, atmosphere, and more.
Ideal for learning database design, SQL queries, and relational concepts.
Feel free to explore our repository to see the database schema, sample data, and documentation. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand databases or an enthusiast interested in celestial bodies, this project offers a hands-on learning experience in database design and management.

Get involved, contribute, and learn more about the fascinating world of celestial bodies through data and code. Let's explore the cosmos together!"

Feel free to customize and modify this description to best suit your project and its goals.
